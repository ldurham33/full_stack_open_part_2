# full_stack_open_part_2
Part 2 of the full stack open course
There are 3 different react apps in this repository. One shows information about an arbitrary number of courses and is split into multiple components. The second one accesses apis to show data for various countries. You can type in a search bar, and when 10 or less countries have the contents of the search bar in them, it shows their names with a button next to them. If you click the button, it shows some information on the country, including the current weather in that country's capital. Alternatively, if only one country fits the search term, it will show the information and weather on it. Finally, the third is an app that acts as a phonebook that lets you put in someones name along with a number. You can delete and add to the list, and it will show the current state of the list. It can handle duplicate inputs and has styled messages for succesful adding and errors.
